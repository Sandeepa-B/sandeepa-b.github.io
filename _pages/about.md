Hi there. I'm Sandeepa. I'm a final year PhD candidate in the High Performance Computing Lab at Penn State. I am co-advised by Prof. Chita Das and Prof. Mahmut Kandemir. 

My research primarily focuses on exploring HW-SW co-design solutions for addressing challenges in emerging applications. 

During my PhD, I have worked on performance and energy optimizations for mobile SoCs, specifically for interactive applications like video game streaming. Apart from this, I was also involved in developing the Gemdroid simulation platforms for exploring the design space of mobile SoCs.

I also have hand-on experience in other domains such as compiler and architecture-driven optimiizations while working as an intern at AMD Research in Spring 2022 where I worked on accelerating the multi-dimensional tensor operations through efficient code generation using AMD Optimized C/C++ Compiler (AOCC).
