Hi there. I'm Sandeepa. I'm a final year PhD candidate in the [High Performance Computing Lab](https://www.cse.psu.edu/hpcl/index.html) at [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu/). I am co-advised by [Prof. Chita Das](https://www.cse.psu.edu/hpcl/das.html) and [Prof. Mahmut Kandemir](https://www.cse.psu.edu/hpcl/kandemir/). 

My research primarily focuses on exploring HW-SW co-design solutions for addressing challenges in emerging applications. 

During my PhD, I have worked on performance and energy optimizations for mobile SoCs, specifically for interactive applications like video game streaming. Apart from this, I was also involved in developing the Gemdroid simulation platforms for exploring the design space of mobile SoCs.

I also have hand-on experience in other domains such as compiler and architecture-driven optimizations while working as an intern at AMD Research in Spring 2022, where I worked on accelerating the multi-dimensional tensor operations through efficient code generation using AMD Optimized C/C++ Compiler (AOCC).

Prior to joining Penn State, I did my Bachelors in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering at [NIT Rourkela, India](https://www.nitrkl.ac.in/) and later worked in Ericsson India Global Services from Sep'2013 to Jun'2016.
